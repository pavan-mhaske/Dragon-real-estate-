I will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. 
At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. I will teach you how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action. Indeed a very long video but packed with my years of learning!
